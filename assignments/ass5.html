<p style="text-align: justify; color:white;">
Data provided by Pluto is mostly spatial or has strong relations with the built environment, so I wanted to display something of that theme. Upon reviewing the existing data, I thought an interesting characteristic of each neighborhood would be to show the height of the buildings in each neighborhood. For building height I used the average height of each neighborhood. Although using the median might have presented the neighborhoods more accurately, I wanted to use the average to show how even 1 or 2 extremely tall buildings in the neighborhood will affect the characteristics of its surroundings.
  <p style="text-align: justify; color:white;">
    While going through the data and coupling that with living experience in the city, I started questioning, despite the amount of new developments, how many buildings in NYC were still walk-ups? The data itself only categorizes full residential buildings into walk-ups and elevator. Hence I used the percentage of residential walk-ups in within all residential buildings.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;color:white;">
  I chose a simple histogram for the building heights because I thought it would most similarly represent the acknowledged building form, a visual cue I hoped would be easy to grasp. In representing NYC, I had envisioned a night skyline theme, hence why I chose the black background and a contrasting outline of the bar graph. Next, I wanted to visualize the percentage of elevators against the total sum of completely residential buildings. I chose vertical box-plots, as I thought it might visually mimic elevator shafts.
