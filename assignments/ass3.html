  I think most of the data provided by Pluto is spatial or has strong relations with the built environment, so I wanted to display something of that theme. Upon reviewing the existing data, I thought an interesting characteristic of each neighborhood would be to show the height of the buildings in each neighborhood. Then I began plotting the tallest buildings in each neighborhood. While going through the data and coupling that with living experience in the city, I started questioning, despite the amount of new developments, how many buildings in NYC were still walk-ups? The data itself only categorizes full residential buildings into walk-ups and elevator.
<p id="bodyText">
I chose a simple histogram for the building heights because I thought it would most similarly represent the acknowledged building form, a visual cue I hoped would be easy to grasp. In representing NYC, I had envisioned a night skyline theme, hence why I chose the black background and a contrasting outline of the bar graph. Next, I wanted to visualize the percentage of elevators against the total sum of completely residential buildings. I chose vertical box-plots, as I thought it might visually mimic elevator shafts.
<p id="bodyText">
  From the visualization I hoped to convey the variety in building form and seeing whether there was a relationship between building height (assuming relatively taller buildings are newer developments) and its surrounding. The neighborhoods with the two tallest buildings both had the highest percentage of residential buildings with elevators. Neighborhoods with a lower maximum height tended to have lower percentages of elevator equipped residential buildings.
